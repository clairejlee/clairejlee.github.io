		<title>A Winter Eden</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>A winter garden in an alder swamp, <br>
Where conies now come out to sun and romp, <br>
As near a paradise as it can be <br>
And not melt snow or start a dormant tree. <br>
</p>
		<p>It lifts existence on a plane of snow <br>
One level higher than the earth below, <br>
One level nearer heaven overhead, <br>
And last year's berries shining scarlet red.<br> </p>
		<p>It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast <br>
Where he can stretch and hold his highest feat <br>
On some wild apple tree's young tender bark, <br>
What well may prove the year's high girdle mark. <br>
</p>
		<div>
			<p><h1>So near to paradise all pairing ends: </h1><br>
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,<br> </p>
			<p><h2>Content with bud-inspecting.</h2> <br>They presume <br>
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom. </p>
			<p>A feather-hammer gives a double knock. <br>
This Eden day is done at two o'clock. <br>
An hour of winter day might seem too short <br>
<em>To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.</em><br></p>
