		<title>A Winter Eden</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>A winter garden in an alder swamp, <br>
<h1>Where conies now come out to sun and romp,</h1> <br>
<li>As near a paradise as it can be </li><br>
<li>And not melt snow or start a dormant tree.</li> <br>
</p>
		<p><h6>It lifts existence on a plane of snow</h6> <br>
One level higher than the earth below, <br>
One level nearer heaven overhead, <br>
And last year's berries shining scarlet red.<br> </p>
		<p><h1>It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast</h1> <br>
<li>Where he can stretch and hold his highest feat</li> <br>
<li>On some wild apple tree's young tender bark,</li> <br>
<li>What well may prove the year's high girdle mark.</li> <br>
</p>
		<div>
			<p><h2>So near to paradise all pairing ends: </h2><br>
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,<br> </p>
			<p>Content with bud-inspecting. <br>They presume <br>
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom. </p>
			<p><h3>A feather-hammer gives a double knock. </h3><br>
This Eden day is done at two o'clock. <br>
<h1>An hour of winter day might seem too short </h1><br>
To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.<br></p>
